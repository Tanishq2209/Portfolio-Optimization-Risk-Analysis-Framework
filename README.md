# Portfolio-Optimization-Risk-Analysis-Framework
This is comprehensive quantitative finance project tha combines traditional portfolio optimization with machine learning techniques for enhanced risk management and predictive analytics.

## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated portfolio optimization framework that goes beyond traditional **mean-variance analysis** by integrating **machine learning for risk prediction**, clustering for intelligent asset allocation, and **multiple risk metrics** for comprehensive risk assessment.

## Questions
1. What are the limitations of traditional portfolio optimization techniques?
2. How often it misses hidden risks and lacks the predictive capabilities?
3. Under different economic regimes, how do these risks differ and impact our portfolio?

## Motivation
- Understanding the market of stock market returns 
- Preparing the best optimize portfolio for financial gains
- Mitigating the risk especially in this era of market volatility may be with tarrif wars or major geopolitical events like conflicts between countries
- Potential future implications especially for gaining the optimize returns.

## Methodology & Models
I have used the different strategies and models for this analyzing such as: 
- Data Acquisition (using Stooq_data)
- Risk Analysis (VaR, CVaR, etc.)
- ML Enhancement (Monte Carlo Simulation)
- Optimization (Traditional Portfolio Optimization)
- Visualization (Efficient Frontier Visualization)

**Data analysis** implemented using Python packages **(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SciPy Seaborn, Plotly)**

## Data Description
Data Source (Stooq Market DataFinance,  01/01/2020 - 01/01/2025)\
Stocks used from the US market:\
- NVIDIA Corporation: NVDA
- Tesla, Inc.: TSLA
- Amazon.com, Inc.: AMZN
- Alphabet Inc. (Class C): GOOG
- Apple Inc.: AAPL

**Note:-**\
For Comparing the Beta, I am using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF as a market benchmark.

## Findings/Summary
- Optimal Sharpe Ratio: 1.48 
- Best Sortino Ratio: 2.15  
- Efficient frontier successfully identified 
- ML models achieved 97%+ prediction accuracy 
- Clear risk-return tradeoffs demonstrated 

## Key Takeaways
* Traditional + modern approaches = superior results 
* Machine learning enhances but doesn't replace human judgment 
* Visualization reveals hidden insights 
* Multiple perspectives beat single metrics.
